After installing docker-compose desktop
I ran it locally :
with commands: 
          docker-compose pull
after that:
          docker-compose up

and: 
          docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose-load.yaml up

and finally press on "start" in Docker-Compose and linked it to : http://localhost:8080
